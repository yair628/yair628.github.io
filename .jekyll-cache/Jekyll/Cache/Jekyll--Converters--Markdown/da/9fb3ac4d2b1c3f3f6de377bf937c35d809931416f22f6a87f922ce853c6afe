I"§<p>Any time you pick up a well shuffled deck, you are almost certainly holding an arrangement of cards that has never before existed and will likely never exist again. $52! \approx 10^{68}$. Suppose a new permutation of 52 cards was drawn every second starting from The Big Bang (13.8 billion years ago). You wouldnâ€™t even be close. To count out all 52! permutations you would need $10^{51}$ ages of the universe.
