#########  Special Instructions for baseurl ###############
#
#### Scenario One: If you do not have a Custom Domain #####
#    -  if you are not using a custom domain, the baseurl *must* be set to your repo name
# 
####  Scenario Two: If you have a Custom Domain #####
# 1. If your domain does NOT have a subpath, this leave this value as ""
# 2. If your domain does have a subpath, you must preceed the value with a / and NOT have a / at the end.  
#      For example: 
#           "" is valid
#           "/blog"        is valid
#            "/blog/site/" is invalid  ( / at the end)
#            "/blog/site"  is valid
#            "blog/site"   is invalid  ( because doesn't begin with a /)
#
# 3. You must replace the parameter `baseurl` in _action_files/settings.ini with the same value as you set here but WITHOUT QUOTES.
#
