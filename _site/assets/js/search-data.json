            "content": "Suppose you have a process that can be described by exponential growth. It could be anything: interests on an investment, the early phases of infection in a pandemic, whatever. . It is often convenient to have an idea how fast is the growth by answering the question: . How long will it take for $x$ to double in size, given a growth of $n$% per year? . The rule of thumb I learned a while back is the following: . Doubling time = $ displaystyle frac{70}{n}$ (in years) . Of course, the time unit could be anything you like, I‚Äôll deal here with years for simplicity‚Äôs sake. Specifically, let‚Äôs answer the question: . Israel has currently (2021) a population of 9.2 million, and a growth rate of 1.8% per year. How long will it take for the population to double, assuming a fixed growth rate? . The answer is about 39 years (70 divided by 1.8), but why?! . Let‚Äôs call $x_0$ the population size now, and the growth rate $n$%. After one year, the population will be . $ displaystyle x_1 = x_0 * left( 1 + frac{n}{100} right) $ . Assume that after $k$ years the population will be double, i.e.: . $ displaystyle x_k = x_0 * left( 1 + frac{n}{100} right)^k = 2x_0. $ . Cancelling $x_0$ we get . $ displaystyle left( 1 + frac{n}{100} right)^k = 2. $ . We now take the natural logarith of both sides: . $ displaystyle k ln left( 1 + frac{n}{100} right) = ln(2). $ . Note that we took $k$ out of the exponent and it now multiplies the logarithm on the left-hand side. Multiplying both sides by 100 yields . $ displaystyle100k ln left( 1 + frac{n}{100} right) = 100 ln(2) simeq 69.3. $ . That surely explains the number 70 in the rule of thumb! Because of the properties of logarithms, we put the number 100 as the exponent of the parenthesis: . $ displaystyle k ln left( 1 + frac{n}{100} right)^{100} = 100 ln(2). $ . We are very close to the end! We now remind ourselves that we learned in Calculus the definition of the exponential function: . $ exp(x) = displaystyle lim_{m rightarrow infty} left( 1 + frac{x}{m} right)^{m}. $ . Because the number 100 is ‚Äúquite big‚Äù, we will approximate the parenthesis inside the logarithm with the exponential function, thus . $ k ln exp(n) = 100 ln(2). $ . The logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential, therefore . $ kn = displaystyle100 ln(2). $ . Finally, solving for $k$, we have . $ k = displaystyle frac{100 ln(2)}{n} simeq frac{70}{n}. $ . We have thus shown that the number of years $k$ it will take for Israel to double it‚Äôs population is about $70/n = 70/1.8 = 38.88$ years!! . The exact number, without any approximations, would be . $ k = displaystyle frac{ ln(2)}{ ln(1+n/100)} simeq 38.85. $ . Conclusion: üëç Very impressive rule of thumb üëç .",

This means that it can be imagined as the surface one gets by swiping a straight line through space. In the image below, we see that each of the skewers is exactly straight, but together thay make this beautiful curved shape. . . This project is quite easy to make with skewers, see its instructions here. .

This website allows us to play with the parameters and see how the surface responds. . In my opinion, a static image can‚Äôt convey the beauty of this shape, so I made this gif: . In 2020, Dillon Berger noted on Twitter that the shape of Pringles is a parabolic hyperboloid: .

            "title": "Skewer Hyperboloid",
            "content": ". George Hart is again the hero of this project. Go check out his webpage to see how to build this beautiful shape. All you need to make the skewer hyperboloid is a bunch of skewers and thin elastic bands. . This is an easy project, and the end result is so fun to play with! It is surprising how smoothly this shape morphes when you pull and push the skewers to change the angle, it‚Äôs hard to explain, so you should definitely try it yourself üòÅ. See Annie Perkins‚Äôs video to get a better idea: . The one thing I can add to George Hart‚Äôs page is that after many weeks and months the elastic bands will dry out and break! I gave a skewer hyperboloid to a friend, and one day he arrived at his office and found out that the whole thing had disintegrated overnight, and the skewers were all over the place. I‚Äôm still looking for a suitable substitute to the elastic bands. It must be something flexible that enables us to play with the construction, and at the same time something durable‚Ä¶ I have not found yet the perfect material, if you have a suggestion please write to me. . I wanted my hyperboloid to last for a long time, so after the construction was done, I used super glue to fix the skewers in a particular angle. Now I can‚Äôt play with it, but at least it will not disintegrate overnight in a few months time (hopefully!). . . The mathematical name of this shape is ‚Äúhyperboloid of one sheet‚Äù, and its equation is . x2A2+y2B2‚àíz2C2=0. begin{equation} frac{x^2}{A^2} + frac{y^2}{B^2} - frac{z^2}{C^2} = 0. end{equation}A2x2‚Äã+B2y2‚Äã‚àíC2z2‚Äã=0.‚Äã‚Äã . When $A=B$ the horizontal cross-sections are circles, just like in our construction. The elastic bands effectively allow us to play with the parameter $C$, which controls how fast the hyperboloid grows sideways. There is a wonderful widget in the Interactive Gallery of Quadric Surfaces, its quite fun to play with. . To see how this curved surface can be made entirely out of straight lines, one can define the surface as the set of all parametric curves of the kind . x=A(cos‚Å°Œ∏‚àívsin‚Å°Œ∏)y=B(sin‚Å°Œ∏+vcos‚Å°Œ∏)z=CŒµv. begin{align} x &amp;= A ( cos theta - v sin theta) y &amp;= B ( sin theta + v cos theta) z &amp;= C varepsilon v. end{align}xyz‚Äã=A(cosŒ∏‚àívsinŒ∏)=B(sinŒ∏+vcosŒ∏)=CŒµv.‚Äã‚Äã . Substitute the parametric equations above into the equation of the paraboloid and see that they satisfy it. . There are actually two families of curves, for $ epsilon= pm 1$. I made a Mathematica plot of the two families of lines, in red ($ varepsilon=1$) and in blue ($ varepsilon=-1$), for ten $ theta$ values between 0 and $2 pi$. It‚Äôs easy to see that each family of lines swirls in a different direction. . . The Mathematica code I wrote is . a = 1; b = 1; c = 1; h = 4; n = 10; p1 = ContourPlot3D[ (*hyperboloid*) x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2 == 1, {x, -h, h}, {y, -h, h}, {z, -h, h}, Mesh -&gt; None, ContourStyle -&gt; Opacity[0.4], AxesLabel -&gt; {x, y, z}, LabelStyle -&gt; Large ]; p2 = ParametricPlot3D[ (*red lines*) Table[{ a (Cos[theta] - v Sin[theta]), b (Sin[theta] + v Cos[theta]), c v }, {theta, 0, 2 Pi, 2 Pi/n}], {v, -20, 20}, PlotStyle -&gt; {Red} ]; p3 = ParametricPlot3D[ (*blue lines*) Table[{ a (Cos[theta] - v Sin[theta]), b (Sin[theta] + v Cos[theta]), - c v }, {theta, 0, 2 Pi, 2 Pi/n}], {v, -20, 20}, PlotStyle -&gt; {Blue} ]; Show[{p1, p2, p3}] . .",

The image above shows the 30-cards construction, but it is not identical to what George Hart shows on his card constructions page. I actually used Francesco De Comit√©‚Äôs version, also credited by Hart. The idea is that you strategically cut the cards in very specific places, so that they can be slided together. . Figuring out how to cut the cards was quite hard to me, I had to experiment a lot! George Hart provides printable templates, but their dimensions are different from the cards I used. Finally besides cutting the cards, the task of putting everything together was a nightmare. It‚Äôs been a while since I built this, but I think that I used clothes pegs to hold the cards together before the whole thing is ready. Once you finish building the structure, it should be much more stable (but not enough to throw it in the air!!). . Because there is a 5-fold symmetry, naturally the golden ratio . œÜ=1+52 varphi = frac{1+ sqrt{5}}{2}œÜ=21+5 . ‚Äã‚Äã . figures quite prominently in there. Francesco De Comit√© provides in his Flickr page a plan for how to cut the cards: . . I put the plan above for the future me to understand what it means, because I myself didn‚Äôt use this‚Ä¶ I found in one of my ‚Äúprojects‚Äù folders my own calculations of how to cut the cards. It shows only the cuts on the top side. One should rotate the card 180 degrees and do the same cuts on the other side. For a card of height H and length L, my cutting plan is the following. . . The cuts are the thick blue lines, and the red arrows show the length $L/ varphi$ of one of the cuts and of the uncut (dashed) part. From this I hope you can imagine that when the cards are slided together, the two cuts amount to the length of the whole ‚Äúdiagonal‚Äù, such that the two card ends are flush. I wish I could explain why the plan is what it is, but some time has passed and I have no idea any more ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Ä¶ . .",

About . I‚Äôm interested in the interactions between soil, water and vegetation in drylands, in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Our goal is to understand how the basic processes and feedbacks influence the ecosystem dynamics, and how this knowledge can be used to control those systems. . The common theme between my different research projects is land/ecosystem degradation caused by human activity. . Our research is based on ‚Äúsimple‚Äù mathematical models, that strive to capture the essential physical processes, while providing deep insight into the dynamics of the system. Some of the tools we use in the modeling of environmental questions come from dynamical systems, statistical physics and optimal control theory. . [Read more on current research projects‚Ä¶] .

Samuel Karlin . | Research is what I‚Äôm doing when I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. Wernher von Braun . | Nothing is more practical than a good theory. Kurt Lewin . | Just as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot, as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot, so too there are wavelengths of light we cannot see and flavors we cannot taste. Why then, given our brains wired the way they are, does the remark, ‚ÄúPerhaps there are thoughts we cannot think,‚Äù surprise you?

Niels Bohr . | An expert is one who knows more and more about less and less until he knows absolutely everything about nothing. Nicholas Butler . | Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. George E. P. Box . | Theory is when you know everything but nothing works.

Pedro Domingos, The Master Algorithm . | Thermodynamics is easy ‚Äì I‚Äôve learned it many times. Harvey S. Leff . | Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise. John Tukey, The future of data analysis . | An article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship.

Miguel de Unamuno . | If you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room.

Amos Tversky, on the hot hand fallacy . | Mathematics is the extension of common sense by other means. Jordan Ellenberg, How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking . | If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter. Blaise Pascal . | I am going to give what I will call an elementary demonstration. But elementary does not mean easy to understand.

There may be a large number of steps that hard to follow, but to each does not require already knowing the calculus or Fourier transforms. Richard P. Feynman . | In this section a mathematical model of the growing embryo will be described. This model will be a simplification and an idealization, and consequently a falsification. It is to be hoped that the features retained for discussion are those of greatest importance in the present state of knowledge. Alan Turing, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis . | Problems worthy of attack prove their worth by hitting back. Piet Hein . | Art is solving problems that cannot be formulated before they have been solved. The shaping of the question is part of the answer. Piet Hein . | Physics is the simplest of all the sciences, and fundamental physics‚Å†‚Å†‚Äîthe study of the basic pieces of reality at the deepest level‚Å†‚Äîis the simplest of all. Not ‚Äúsimple‚Äù in the sense that the homework problems are easy, but simple in the sense that Galileo‚Äôs trick of ignoring friction and air resistance makes our lives easier. The reason why physics classes seem so hard is not because physics is so hard‚Äîit‚Äôs because we understand so much of it that there‚Äôs a lot to learn, and that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs fundamentally pretty simple. Sean Carroll, The Big Picture . | Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better. Edsger W. Dijkstra . | The fundamental role of a teacher is not to deliver information. It is guide the social process of learning. The job of a teacher is to inspire, to challenge, to excite their students to want to learn. Yes, they also do explain and demonstrate and show things, but fundamentally that is beside the point. The most important thing a teacher does is make every student feel like they are important, to make them feel accountable for doing the work of learning. Derek Alexander Muller, youtube . | What is the first business of one who practices philosophy? To get rid of self-conceit. For it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows. Epictetus . | Confusion is a feeling that precedes learning something.

Said to be engraved on the door of Plato‚Äôs Academy, the oldest recorded entrance requirement of a college . | We don‚Äôt use heuristics just because they are fast and efficient. We use them because they are less precise and thus less vulnerable to be misled by noise. A good heuristic is to distrust whoever adds or requires unnecessary precision. Another good heuristic is to distrust whoever thinks that precision always correlates with correctness.

Principle 1 - Don‚Äôt Put Words On Slides It may not seem intuitive, but including words on slides has a bigger detrimental effect on the quality of a talk than any other issue I will address. . The slides in most science talks contain many words. This simple fact has many consequences, none positive. Most obviously, words on slides impel listeners to read the words on the slide. If you are talking while they are reading, then you generate cognitive dissonance that makes it difficult for the audience to understand either your spoken words or your written words. So, if you want your audience to read the words on a slide, then, presumably, you should shut up. But, I don‚Äôt recommend that. Instead, just cut all the words form your slides. . The David Attenborough Style of Scientific Presentation . [The David Attenborough Style of Scientific Presentation.] . Excerpt: . Get into this mindset: your main job is to be an entertainer, not a scientist. Most scientists don‚Äôt do this, which is why most scientific talks are bad.

          "content": "Research . . Interests . I‚Äôm interested in the interactions between soil, water and vegetation in drylands, in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Our goal is to understand how the basic processes and feedbacks influence the ecosystem dynamics, and how this knowledge can be used to control those systems. . The common theme between my different research projects is land/ecosystem degradation caused by human activity. . Our research is based on ‚Äúsimple‚Äù mathematical models, that strive to capture the essential physical processes, while providing deep insight into the dynamics of the system. Some of the tools we use in the modeling of environmental questions come from dynamical systems, statistical physics and optimal control theory. . We are recruiting excellent students to our group! Here you can find some more detail on our current projects. . Projects . Soil salinization . Every week, the world loses an area greater than Manhattan to salt-related soil degradation. It is estimated that 20% of all irrigated lands are affected by salinity, with an even higher fraction of salt-degraded soils in arid and semiarid regions. Salt accumulation in the soil, usually induced by insufficient drainage and poor-quality irrigation water, imposes severe restrictions on food production. . Some of the questions we‚Äôd like to answer are: On what time scales the salinization process occurs, and what is the effect of a drier and more extreme climate on the salt buildup? What are the critical thresholds for (irreversible) soil degradation? How can we rehabilitate a degraded soil by making optimal use of the resources available? What role can treated wastewater have on dryland agriculture that is sustainable with respect to the ecosystem services? ‚Äã . Nutrient dynamics . Nitrogen management is of critical importance to food security and environmental sustainability. Because of artificial fertilizers, we have seen a sharp increase in agricultural production in the last century. However, the same nitrogen available to plant uptake, can polute the groundwater, streams and lakes, and be released as nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. . We would like to understand how the nonlinear dynamics of nitrogen and carbon cycling is influenced by the hydrological cycle. In particular, we would like to study the influence of random rainfall events and a changing climate in driving these cycles. . Tree water balance in a semiarid pine forest and rates of survival under global climate change . Longer droughts and temperature rise impose severe risks of widespread forest mortality. Drought-adapted trees in semiarid and arid ecosystems cope with water stress by regulating their transpiration rate, thus saving internal water content and avoiding runaway decline in water potential. . Our goal is to characterize how trees manage their water budget in order to increase survival probability under prolonged drought periods. . Our group will approach these objectives by modeling the soil-tree-atmosphere water transport to assess tree survival probability for current and future climate scenarios. A collaboration with an experimental group will provide us data from a research station in the Yatir forest, in the Negev desert (see map above). . Studying the fate of the Yatir forest gives us a window into the future, for it is expected that many ecosystems around the world will face increasing drought stress as a result of climate change. .",

We want students to creatively engage with their projects, finding by themselves solutions to the challenges they encounter. The role of the teaching staff will be to consult and advise, not spoon-feed solutions. . The main values we would like to promote: curiosity, independence, creativity, and a can-do attitude. . Guiding questions and Description . This course deals with the design of a simple experiment focusing on data collection and analysis. The guiding questions throughout this course are: . What is my research question? | What data is needed? | How will data be collected? | How will data be analyzed? | How will data be reported? | . Throughout the course, students will critically engage with each of these questions, and as a case study, will build an experiment to monitor the flow of water in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, first a joint experiment for the whole class and then a private project which will be selected from a list of topics. The list of projects covers several disciplines, including biological and microbiological science, as well as soil and water sciences. The culmination of this course will be a final project, in which students will devise an experiment and apply the acquired tools to a subject of their choosing, and submit a report on it. See below some of the past projects developed in our course. . The monitoring and control systems to be build are based on the ESP32, a versatile (and cheap!) microcontroller.
